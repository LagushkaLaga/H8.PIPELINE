Raspberry Pi GStreamer based applications
=========================================

Where should I start?
---------------------

That's a great question! Hailo provides a `Sanity Pipeline <sanity_pipeline/README.rst>`_ that helps you verify that the installation phase went well. This is a good starting point.


#. `Sanity Pipeline <sanity_pipeline/README.rst>`_ - Helps you verify that all the required components are installed correctly
#. `Detection <detection/README.rst>`_ - single-stream object detection pipeline on top of GStreamer using the Hailo-8 device.
#. `Depth Estimation <depth_estimation/README.rst>`_ - single-stream depth estimation pipeline on top of GStreamer using the Hailo-8 device.
#. `Multinetworks parallel <multinetworks_parallel/README.rst>`_ - single-stream multi-networks pipeline on top of GStreamer using the Hailo-8 device.
#. `Pose Estimation <pose_estimation/../README.rst>`_ - Human pose estimation using ``centerpose`` network.
#. `Face Detection <face_detection/README.rst>`_ - Face detection application.
#. `Face Detection and Facial Landmarking Pipeline <cascading_networks/README.rst>`_ - Face detection and then facial landmarking.
#. `Classification <classification/README.rst>`_ - Classification app using ``resnet_v1_50``.
